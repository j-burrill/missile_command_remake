# missile_command_remake
Welcome to my remake of Missile Command for the Atari 2600

In order to play with custom settings, make sure you edit the "data\cfg_custom.json" file and have the "custom" cfg selected.
Pressing TAB while on the menu will toggle between different configs (essentially gamemodes).

Each gamemode has its own leaderboard.

While playing multiplayer, red uses WASD to move and SHIFT to shoot while blue uses the arrow keys and CTRL.
