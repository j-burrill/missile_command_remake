# missile_command_remake
Welcome to my remake of Missile Command for the Atari 2600

If you want to change the settings, make sure you edit the "data\cfg.json" file. Pressing TAB while on the menu will toggle between the default cfg and your custom one.
Highscores will only be saved if you use the default cfg.
